          <h4><strong>The Naming</strong></h4>
          <h6>
            "Culann the smith invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before
            going, Conchobar goes to the playing field to watch the boys play
            hurling. He is so impressed by Sétanta's performance that he asks
            him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but
            promises to follow the king later.
            <br />

            But Conchobar forgets to tell Culann, who lets his ferocious hound
            loose to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound
            attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by
            smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a
            sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley.
            <br />

            Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so Sétanta promises
            he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the
            job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad
            announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's
            Hound"."

          <h4>
            <strong>The Cattle Raid of Cooley ("Táin Bó Cúailnge")</strong>
          </h4>

          <h6>
            At the age of seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster
            from the army of Connacht in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Medb, queen of
            Connacht, has mounted the invasion to steal the stud bull Donn
            Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because
            he was with a woman when he should have been watching the border.
            The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to
            suffer from labour pains.
            <br />

            So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing
            further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at
            fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts
            for months. Before one combat a beautiful young woman comes to him,
            claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but
            he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the Morrígan, and in
            revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms
            while he is engaged in combat against Lóch mac Mofemis. As an eel,
            she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she
            stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a
            sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer at the head of the
            stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone. After Cú
            Chulainn finally defeats Lóch, the Morrígan appears to him as an old
            woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her
            animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each
            drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.
            <br />

            After one particularly arduous combat, Cú Chulainn lies severely
            wounded but is visited by Lug, who tells him he is his father and
            heals his wounds. When Cú Chulainn wakes up and sees that the
            boy-troop of Emain Macha have attacked the Connacht army and been
            slaughtered, he has his most spectacular ríastrad yet: The first
            warp-spasm seized Cúchulainn, and made him into a monstrous thing,
            hideous and shapeless, unheard of. His shanks and his joints, every
            knuckle and angle and organ from head to foot, shook like a tree in
            the flood or a reed in the stream. His body made a furious twist
            inside his skin, so that his feet and shins switched to the rear and
            his heels and calves switched to the front... On his head the
            temple-sinews stretched to the nape of his neck, each mighty,
            immense, measureless knob as big as the head of a month-old child...
            he sucked one eye so deep into his head that a wild crane couldn't
            probe it onto his cheek out of the depths of his skull; the other
            eye fell out along his cheek. His mouth weirdly distorted: his cheek
            peeled back from his jaws until the gullet appeared, his lungs and
            his liver flapped in his mouth and throat, his lower jaw struck the
            upper a lion-killing blow, and fiery flakes large as a ram's fleece
            reached his mouth from his throat... The hair of his head twisted
            like the tangle of a red thornbush stuck in a gap; if a royal apple
            tree with all its kingly fruit were shaken above him, scarce an
            apple would reach the ground but each would be spiked on a bristle
            of his hair as it stood up on his scalp with rage.
            <br />

            1969, pp. 150–153 He attacks the army and kills hundreds, building
            walls of corpses. "Cuchulainn Carries Ferdiad Across the River",
            illustration by Ernest Wallcousins from Charles Squire, Celtic Myths
            and Legends, 1905 When his foster-father Fergus mac Róich, now in
            exile in Medb's court, is sent to face him Cú Chulainn agrees to
            yield, so long as Fergus agrees to return the favour the next time
            they meet. Finally, he fights a gruelling three-day duel with his
            best friend and foster-brother, Ferdiad, at a ford that was named
            Áth Fhir Diadh (Ardee, County Louth) after him.
            <br />

            The Ulstermen eventually rouse, one by one at first, and finally en
            masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines,
            recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He
            enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps his side of the
            bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field.
            Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat and
            although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through
            as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he
            spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and
            guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone. 28][29][30]

          <h4><strong>The death of Cú Chulainn</strong></h4>
          <h6>
            Medb conspires with Lugaid, son of Cú Roí, Erc, son of Cairbre Nia
            Fer, and the sons of others Cú Chulainn had killed, to draw him out
            to his death. His fate is sealed by his breaking of the geasa
            (taboos) upon him. Cú Chulainn's geasa included a ban against eating
            dog meat, but in early Ireland there was a powerful general taboo
            against refusing hospitality, so when an old crone offers him a meal
            of dog meat, he has no choice but to break his geis. In this way he
            is spiritually weakened for the fight ahead of him. Lugaid has three
            magical spears made, and it is prophesied that a king will fall by
            each of them. With the first he kills Cú Chulainn's charioteer Láeg,
            king of chariot drivers. With the second he kills Cú Chulainn's
            horse, Liath Macha, king of horses. With the third he hits Cú
            Chulainn, mortally wounding him. Cú Chulainn ties himself to a
            standing stone to die on his feet, facing his enemies. This stone is
            traditionally identified as Clochafarmore, located near Dundalk.[34]
            Due to his ferocity even when so near death, it is only when a raven
            lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead. Lugaid
            approaches and cuts off his head, but as he does so the "hero-light"
            burns around Cú Chulainn and his sword falls from his hand and cuts
            Lugaid's hand off. The light disappears only after his right hand,
            his sword arm, is cut from his body. According to the Annals, Cú
            Chulainn died in the year AD 1.[35] Conall Cernach had sworn that if
            Cú Chulainn died before him he would avenge him before sunset, and
            when he hears Cú Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has
            lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt,
            but he only beats him after his horse takes a bite out of Lugaid's
            side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where
            Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.[36]
